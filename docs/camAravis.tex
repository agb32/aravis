TODO:  Make this into valid latex

Documentation here... of darc aravis module.

Used with bobcat cameras so far, should work for any.

conf/configBobcatNcam.py



The prefix will determine number of cameras.
If no prefix: 1 camera.
If prefix==bob:  1 camera
If prefix=N (N an integer):  That many cameras
If prefix=bobN:  N cameras.
Any other prefix: 4 cameras.

Parameters for dynamic setting in darc (or in the initial config file):


aravisCmd0,1,2,3 to set commands on individual cameras.
aravisCmdAll to set on all of them.

e.g.
darcmagic set aravisCmdAll -string="ProgFrameTimeAbs=100000;" --prefix=bob4
will set all to 100Hz.

aravisGet can be used for getting parameters.
darcmagic set aravisGet -string="?0:ProgFrameTimeAbs"
darcmagic get aravisGet
[which will return 100000, or whatever value is set].

The number after the ? is the camera number to query.

With multiple cameras >3, real-time OS seems to be necessary at higher frame rates.

At a later date, I might try making the main loop more efficient in arvgvstream.c, by making the assumtion that packets appear in order (which is probably valid when cameras are connected directly).
